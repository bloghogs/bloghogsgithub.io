    <p class="post-text">A powerful graphics card generally has a high-performance GPU (graphics processing unit) with a large number of CUDA cores, 
        a high clock speed, and a large amount of memory (VRAM). It should also have a powerful cooling system to keep the card from overheating during intense usage. 
        Additionally, it should have support for the latest technologies such as ray tracing, AI-acceleration, and support for high-resolution and high refresh rate displays. 
        Additionally, it should have a good design with good power management and power delivery to ensure the GPU runs stable and at peak performance.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">1. GeForce RTX 4090</h2>
    <p class="post-text">The GeForce RTX 4090 is the most powerful graphics card offered by NVIDIA, featuring their new Ada Lovelace architecture. 
        It offers up to 55% faster performance than the RTX 3090 Ti in standard gaming benchmarks and 78% faster performance in games with heavy ray tracing effects. 
        It's also 25% faster in traditional rasterization games and over double the performance in ray tracing games compared to AMD's RX 7900 XTX. However, 
        it's best used with a high refresh rate 4K monitor and requires a CPU and power supply upgrade. It also has a very high price and is often out of 
        stock due to scalpers pushing prices above $2,000.<br>
        It is designed for professional content creation and AI tasks, and it's performance in those areas 
        are much more superior than any other GPU in the market.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">4. Radeon RX 6600</h2>
    <p class="post-text">The Radeon RX 6600 is a powerful graphics card that offers great value for its price. 
        It's about 15% slower overall than the 6650 XT and about 30% faster than the RTX 3050. Prices for the RX 6600 have recently crept back up 
        slightly higher than its usual price, but still well priced none the less.
        It's a great option for those who are looking for a decent mainstream solution at a cheaper price than the more 
        expensive options from AMD and Nvidia. The RX 6600 delivers near-RTX 2070 performance in non-ray tracing scenarios, but struggles with ray tracing, 
        barely averaging 30 fps in our DXR test suite at 1080p medium and trailing Nvidia's RTX 2060 by 20%. <br>
        Overall, the RX 6600 is a great option for those who are not worried about ray tracing.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">5. GeForce RTX 4070 Ti</h2>
    <p class="post-text">The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is a new generation GPU that is 10-15% faster than the previous generation RTX 3080. It comes with the latest 
        Ada Lovelace architecture and features and costs about 20% more than the cheapest 3080. It is not considered a great value, but it is still faster 
        than the previous generation. Nvidia is promoting the use of DLSS 3, which can improve the performance by 10-20%. The 4070 Ti is currently available 
        but supply is limited and prices are high.</p>
